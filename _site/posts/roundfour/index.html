<p>I built an entire React Native app, almost entirely alone, and now it's winging its way to the Google Play store. It's for my day job and I can't really talk about it in any great depth other than to say the MVP is complete. Woo!</p>
<p>I was working so hard on it that I neglected to update this blog, which is the place I was supposed to be making a record of my wins along the way. I let time get away from me a little here, but that's OK. I have an idea.</p>
<h2 id="flashcards">FLASHCARDS <a class="direct-link" href="#flashcards" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I've been learning German on and off since May, and I've been learning React Native since August. Both of these things have been competing for my attention lately and I have often wished for a beautiful and reliable repetitive learning app so that I can get my head around the horrifying German cases <em>and</em> skill up on programming concepts more broadly, with specific reference to React Native at the moment.</p>
<p>So I'm going to combine the two. Over the next few months I'm going to build Flashcards for iOS in React Native. I plan to play around with fun things such as animation APIs and will no doubt rely on Nader Dabit's wonderful book on React Native to guide me along.</p>
<p>I'll document the process here for anyone that's interested. I have built a project in RN now, so I know my way around a little, but I'm by no means an expert.</p>
<h2 id="starting-up">Starting up <a class="direct-link" href="#starting-up" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
<p>I followed the <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started">Getting Started section of the official docs</a> and adjusted the settings for the React Native CLI Quickstart, the macOS development settings and the iOS target OS settings.</p>
<p>I'll be posting again soon to talk about how I plan to approach the project, the tools I'll be using, and anything else that springs to mind.</p>
<h2 id="bye-bye!">Bye bye! <a class="direct-link" href="#bye-bye!" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>
