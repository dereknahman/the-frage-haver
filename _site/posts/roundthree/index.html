<h2 id="responsive-design">RESPONSIVE DESIGN <a class="direct-link" href="#responsive-design">#</a></h2>
<p>As I learned a couple of weeks ago, 'responsive design' is something that one should prioritise if they want a happy life. I spent a solid month building my app on a single Samsung emulator and thought I was doing a good job until my boss asked me to open the app in a much larger emulator. Oh boy! Suddenly my carefully centered views were running halfway off the screen, mountains crumbled, seas roared, and I had to stay late to fix it.</p>
<p>So, responsive design. It's important.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-make-sure-that-my-components-are-the-same-size-on-all-devices%3F">How can I make sure that my components are the same size on all devices? <a class="direct-link" href="#how-can-i-make-sure-that-my-components-are-the-same-size-on-all-devices%3F">#</a></h2>
<p>Honestly, this is a question I could use some answers to. I'm going to tell you what I've been doing and hopefully someone will see this on Twitter and glide in with some helpful suggestions.</p>
<p>I have been (over?)relying on <code>Dimensions.get</code>.</p>
<p>I'll give you an example. I have used <code>Dimensions.get</code> to ensure my fonts render in sizes proportionate to the size of the screens on which they are displayed.</p>
<p>I've been storing the width and height of the screen in variables like so:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token keyword">const</span> screenWidth <span class="token operator">=</span> Dimensions<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">get</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'screen'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>width</span><br><span class="highlight-line"><span class="token keyword">const</span> screenHeight <span class="token operator">=</span> Dimensions<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token function">get</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'screen'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>height</span></code></pre>
<p>Then, in my StyleSheet, I've been doing this, and sometimes I divide the screenWidth by a certain number to achieve the result I want:</p>
<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="language-javascript"><span class="highlight-line">  stopButtonText<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">    fontSize<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token number">0.039</span> <span class="token operator">*</span> screenWidth<span class="token punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">    color<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'#EE7470'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">    fontWeight<span class="token operator">:</span> <span class="token string">'bold'</span></span><br><span class="highlight-line">  <span class="token punctuation">}</span></span></code></pre>
<p>Can I tell you why exactly I chose the number 0.039? Nope. Does it work? Absolutely!</p>
<p>They don't make very much of <code>Dimensions.get</code> in the official documentation. As far as I can see, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/dimensions">this is the only mention of it</a>, but I might be wrong. I know that they're in the process of revamping the documentation to make it more user-friendly so I really wouldn't be surprised if things changed for the better in the coming months, but for now this is a bit of a pain point.</p>
<h2 id="and-that's-all-for-now">AND THAT'S ALL FOR NOW <a class="direct-link" href="#and-that's-all-for-now">#</a></h2>
<p>It's a quick one today.</p>
