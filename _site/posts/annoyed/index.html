<p>I started this blog to track side-projects and independent learning. I naffed this up on the following count:</p>
<p>Good luck having time for side-projects when you're attending German classes two evenings per week, have a demanding job and for some reason insist on having &quot;&quot;&quot;friends&quot;&quot;&quot; who you &quot;&quot;&quot;see on a regular basis&quot;&quot;&quot; for &quot;&quot;&quot;non-marketable enjoyment&quot;&quot;&quot;. I do quite like sleeping sometimes, too. And reading books not about programming. Being outside. That stuff.</p>
<h3 id="not-working-yourself-into-misery-is-good!">Not working yourself into misery is good! <a class="direct-link" href="#not-working-yourself-into-misery-is-good!" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>But German class is over now and I won't be going back to learning in a formal environment. There's more time. Work is even <em>more</em> demanding than it has been in previous months but it's not a disaster, mostly because I have the psychic cushion of looking for new work to fall back on. Now I have some time for messing about with JavaScript in my spare time, which, to be fair, I do really enjoy when it doesn't feel like yet another obligation.</p>
<h3 id="but.">But. <a class="direct-link" href="#but." aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>
<p>I can't be bothered to do something elaborate. I've realised I have a terrible habit of setting the bar enormously high, inevitably not meeting it, despairing and suffering from mild to moderate psychological bruising for a short time afterwards. And I want to keep seeing my friends and reading novels and staring cross-eyed into thin air because I am a human being and not a node module with legs and fantastic hair.</p>
<p>Part of the reason why I set such horrible, demanding targets for myself is that I am incredibly uncomfortable with being crap at things, and having other people see me being crap at things. I am critical of capitalism in the streets yet I push myself forward with enormous force on the basis of personal betterment at the expense of mental health in the sheets. It's not good. This mindset is also wholly incompatible with learning how to program (and enjoying it!) and I can see that I need to sort it out.</p>

<p>I'm going to build some vanilla JS/HTML/CSS things over the next couple of months, for fun. They're probably going to be silly, like <a href="https://dereknahman.github.io/steve-mcfaddens-theremin/">Steve McFadden's Magic Theremin</a>. They will all be relatively simple. I hope to learn a lot. I hope you find it interesting.</p>
<p>I'll be posting Ayn Rand's Savings Calculator in the next couple of weeks.</p>
