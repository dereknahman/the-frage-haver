      <h1>hello, world!</h1>

<p>I started this blog for a few reasons:</p>
<p>👉🏻 To record questions I have about the new technologies I’m learning.</p>
<p>👉🏻 To publicly answer these questions so that others might learn from them too.</p>
<p>👉🏻 To keep a record of my progresss as I <s>work at becoming</s> become a better developer.</p>
<p>The format is simple.</p>
<p>I’m going to record the questions that arise as I bash my head against new concepts and languages, and I’ll answer each one of them here.</p>
<p>The shape of this blog will remain the same, but the subject matter will change over time.</p>

<p>Disclaimer: I’m a career-changer bootcamp grad and I wrote my first line of code about eight months ago. I’ve worked hard in that time but I’m by no means an expert, so these questions are coming from a code newbie. You might find this blog pedestrian if you’re an expert, in which case: bite me!</p>
