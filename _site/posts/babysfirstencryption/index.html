<p>I didn't know anything about security, really. I probably should have, but I didn't. Lots of interesting people with part-shaved, multi-coloured hair on Twitter know about security and they're super smart and cool but I never understand what they're talking about and merely look on in awe while they say hackerish sounding things before going back to fixing the styling on my buttons.</p>
<p>My CTO at work recently asked me to assess how secure the password-handling was in a React Native application written by a third party. I looked at the Login.js component, which contained the relevant logic, and could see that the password wasn't hashed anywhere, but that's about it. I definitely didn't feel qualified to comment on the code from a security standpoint at the time.</p>
<p>My CTO then followed up with a recommendation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>&quot;If you want a fun trip down a rabbit hole, look up md5, sha-1 and bcrypt password hashing. Also why is salting important? And what does Rails use?&quot;</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>So off I went.</p>
<h2 id="md5">md5 <a class="direct-link" href="#md5">#</a></h2>
<p>I'll start with the definition first, and then we can break it down together.</p>
<p><strong>MD5 hash functions are a one-way cryptographic function that accepts a message of any length and returns as output a fixed-length digest value to be used for authenticating the original message</strong></p>
<p>But what's a hash ???</p>
<p>A 'one-way cryptographic function' ???</p>
<p>What's a fixed length digest value ???</p>
<p>Can we see an example in JavaScript ???</p>
<h2 id="sha-1">sha-1 <a class="direct-link" href="#sha-1">#</a></h2>
<h2 id="bcrypt">bcrypt <a class="direct-link" href="#bcrypt">#</a></h2>
