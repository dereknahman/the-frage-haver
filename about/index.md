I am Kirsty, 29. I'm from London and I live here now after a great year-and-a-bit spent in Berlin learning to code.

I used to work in architecture and journalism and now I'm a programmer.

I work at an agency with primarily third-sector clients, which I love.

I love problem-solving and learning new things.

You can find me at kirstysimmonds@icloud.com or at [@keinegurke\_](https://twitter.com/keinegurke_).

(I donâ€™t like cucumbers.)

P.S. Frage is German for question.
