I started this blog for a few reasons:

👉🏻 To record questions I have about the new technologies I’m learning.

👉🏻 To publicly answer these questions so that others might learn from them too.

👉🏻 To keep a record of my progresss as I work at becoming become a better developer.

The format is simple.

I’m going to record the questions that arise as I bash my head against new concepts and languages, and I’ll answer each one of them here.

The shape of this blog will remain the same, but the subject matter will change over time. At the moment I’m learning React, and in future it’ll be React Native, Rust, Elixir and Phoenix, and probably lots of other things I don’t I’m into yet.

## I’m really excited!

Disclaimer: I’m a career-changer bootcamp grad and I wrote my first line of code about eight months ago. I’ve worked hard in that time but I’m by no means an expert, so these questions are coming from a code newbie. You might find this blog pedestrian if you’re an expert, in which case: bite me!
