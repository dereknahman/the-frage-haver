I started this blog for a few reasons:

👉🏻 To record questions I have about the new technologies I’m learning.

👉🏻 To publicly answer these questions so that others might learn from them too.

👉🏻 To keep a record of my progresss as I ~~work at becoming~~ become a better developer.

The format is simple.

I’m going to record the questions that arise as I bash my head against new concepts and languages, and I’ll answer each one of them here.

The shape of this blog will remain the same, but the subject matter will change over time.
