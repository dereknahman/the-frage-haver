## It's been a while

I built an entire React Native app, almost entirely alone, and now it's winging its way to the Google Play store. It's for my day job and I can't really talk about it in any great depth other than to say the MVP is complete. Woo!

I was working so hard on it that I neglected to update this blog, which is the place I was supposed to be making a record of my wins along the way. I let time get away from me a little here, but that's OK. I have an idea.

## FLASHCARDS

I've been learning German on and off since May, and I've been learning React Native since August. Both of these things have been competing for my attention lately and I have often wished for a beautiful and reliable repetitive learning app so that I can get my head around the horrifying German cases *and* skill up on programming concepts more broadly, with specific reference to React Native at the moment.

So I'm going to combine the two. Over the next few months I'm going to build Flashcards for iOS in React Native. I plan to play around with fun things such as animation APIs and will no doubt rely on Nader Dabit's wonderful book on React Native to guide me along.

I'll document the process here for anyone that's interested. I have built a project in RN now, so I know my way around a little, but I'm by no means an expert.

## Starting up

I followed the [Getting Started section of the official docs](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started) and adjusted the settings for the React Native CLI Quickstart, the macOS development settings and the iOS target OS settings.

I'll be posting again soon to talk about how I plan to approach the project, the tools I'll be using, and anything else that springs to mind.

## Bye bye!
